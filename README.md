# Margo EasyCLA Repository
This is a repository to assist Margo Specification contributors to sign the CCLA or ICLA documents. Please open a trivial PR on this repository to initiate the EasyCLA signing process, which will authorize your contribution(s) to Margo repositories. All PRs will be closed periodically. 

# Contributing to Margo Specifications
This repository is managed by EasyCLA, a bot that ensures contributors have been covered by the appropriate License Agreement. Corporate contributors must sign the [Membership Agreement]() before making a contribution. Individual contributors must sign the [Non-Member Feedback Agreement](). Both documents only need to be executed once. 

To initiate the signature process, or to check to see if you are already covered by an existing CCLA, please open a PR against this repo. The EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we don't have the appropriate agreement in place. 

If you are the CLA Manager for your organization - in other words, you are the person who can authorize others in your organization to contribute to Margo - you may manage or authorize contributors at https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/.

If you have issues, please email [operations@margo.org](mailto:operations@margo.org).
